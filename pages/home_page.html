              Boston may be best known for being the home of some world-famous
              universities and sports teams such as Harvard and latterly, the
              Red Sox but there is so much more to this small city on the east
              coast of the USA. Excellent food, world-class museums and an
              hour’s drive from the beaches of Cape Cod, Boston is a great city
              to base yourself whilst exploring the beautiful state of
              Massachusetts.
              <br />

              No trip to Boston is complete unless you have bought some cannoli

              During the summer, Boston is almost deserted by locals as they
